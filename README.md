# Vue GTS Starter

[![Code Style: Google](https://img.shields.io/badge/code%20style-google-blueviolet.svg)](https://github.com/google/gts)

This is a [Vue](https://vuejs.org) starter project that complies with [Google TypeScript Style](https://github.com/google/gts). Compatible with [Vue CLI](https://cli.vuejs.org/).

You can also add [Bootstrap-vue](https://bootstrap-vue.org/), [Vuetify](https://vuetifyjs.com/), etc. to this project.

## Project setup

```sh
npm install
```

### Compiles and hot-reloads for development

```sh
npm run serve
```

### Compiles and minifies for production

```sh
npm run build
```

### Lints and fixes files

```sh
npm run lint
```

### Gts commands

If you want to execute gts directly, prefix `gts:` as shown below. However, it doesn't make much sense because you can do the same with the above command.

* `gts:lint`: Lints and checks for formatting problems.
* `gts:fix`: Automatically fixes formatting and linting problems (if possible).
* `gts:clean`: Removes output files.

### Customize configuration

See [Configuration Reference](https://cli.vuejs.org/config/).
